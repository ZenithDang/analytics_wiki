## What is analytics?

Analytics is the process using data to find patterns and extract insights. Generally analytics is undertaken to try and optimize a process, like in a business setting to maximize profit. A basic example of analytics in business settings would include the usage of dashboard to visualize and explain data, in an attempt to make data driven decisions. Other examples would include using mathematical models to determine optimal resource allocations given business rules and constraints, or using data to understand consumer behaviour and use this knowledge to cut low potential prototypes from further investment and redirect that to high potential products. 

Though analytics can also be used in more academic ways to make inference from experimental or observational data and to measure the causal relationships between different phenomena in our environment. An example of this would be the application of statistics (usually called econometrics) in field of statistics. Though other examples include in public policy (for example, determining the impact of social security on increasing individuals welfare and job prospects) or health (predicting patients likely to suffer certain diseases).

## Why do analytics? 

Analytics in business settings is almost always done to optimize some variable(s) that impact or drive profit. Though in less profit driven areas such as academic settings, government and not for profit, analytics is often used to model the real world, establish causal relationships and optimize on non profit related variables such social welfare, environmental factors or economic outcomes. 

Taking a step back, analytics can be broadly split into three main areas depending on the purpose of the analysis. These are: 

- Descriptive analysis: this focuses on explaining what has happened. For example has profit gone up? what was inflation last quarter? has their living standards increased? 
- Predictive analysis: this focuses on predicting what could happen based on the data. This focuses on measuring the likelihood off different outcomes to make predictions.
- Prescriptive analysis: For example will profit go up if I sell more items? will inflation increase next quarter? if I implement this social policy what will happen to living standards? 

## Predictive vs Prescriptive

The main difference is that prescriptive is more closely aligned with causal analytics. Prescriptive focuses on explaining what should happen using the data, where predictive is more what is likely to happen using the data. Prescriptive focuses on establishing and measuring relationships so that it can be understood what should happen in an intervention scenario. In predictive the focus is on simply making models that best fit the data and give accurate predictions, the causal or theoretical validity of the relationships in the model matter less as the focuses is solely on predictive power. This is useful when no intervention actions is to be taken using the model, but simply decisions will be made that will not impact the dependent variable (e.g. predicting the weather, or stock prices). 

## Typical Analytics Project 

A standard analytics project regardless of being in a for profit setting or otherwise will generally have the following stages. 

1. Discovery: this involves understanding the problem, requirements, and data  
2. Data preparation: this involves collecting, cleaning and shaping the data 
3. Exploratory Data Analysis: this involves developing a deep understanding of the data 
4. Data modelling: this involves creating statistical models to explain a dependent variable
5. Model evaluation: this involves comparing models and validating findings 
6. Model Communication: this can be deploying with an API or a research report 

## Typical Roles in a Analytics Project 

While a data analyst or data scientist can and usually does do the majority of the steps a typical analytics project, this is not always the case. In large organizations, team members will usually specialize into specific areas. Below are some typical roles that you may find in large organizations: 

- Data Analyst: Focuses on using [Statistics](Statistics.md) and visual methods to analyse data. Will usually prepare reports for stakeholders and conduct ad hoc analysis. They may also use machine learning and AI though, typically not as frequent as a data scientist. 
- Data Scientist: Focuses on using AI methods ([Statistics](Statistics.md)) to analyse data. They may prepare reports and conduct ad hoc analysis, but usually the ML models will be deployed using an API to assist in business processes. 
- Data Engineer: Focuses on creating the systems that retrieve, process and store data to make it accessible for downstream consumers. They typically fall more on the operations side though will also do development work when new systems and data streams are required. 
- BI Analyst: A very similar role to a data analyst but with a focus on dashboards and regular reporting. They will usually focus on visualization methods to create dashboards to support in more operational focuses areas. 

## Related Areas in Data 

People who work in business analytics will get to interact with the majority of areas in a business. All functions will deal with some degree of data and will have a certain need for analytics. Usually it begins with understanding their data and having situational awareness on what is happening (Business intelligence) and evolves into wanting more advanced insights to either predict outcomes, or understand relationships between variables. Furthermore, optimization methods are popular in operations focused areas to determine things such as routes, resource allocation, and scheduling.  

As an organisation grows, they usually will require a team just to maintain the data they are collecting. This involves managing how it is stored, how it is organised and how it is made accessible. This results in additional areas in data other than analytics. Examples include: 

- Data Governance: focuses on the management, security and access of data. They do things like implement access policy, architecture of the technology stack, and creation of tools like data catalogues and dictionaries. They will also usually determine the tech stack ([Technology](Technology.md)) used for data processing by the organisation. 
- Business Intelligence: focuses on operational and stakeholder reporting and dashboards. Typically they do less ad hoc analysis but create processes to regularly provide insights to stakeholders. Generally, the analysis conducted is descriptive and aims to give situational awareness, though predictive analysis can also be present with the aim of indicating areas to focus on or highlighting trouble spots. 
- Data security: similar to data governance, but with a focus on security, both in terms of internal access policies, but also in preventing external unauthorized access. 
- AI: focus on creating AI products for consumers. This includes creating predictive models like a data scientist but also products like large language models or or image processors. 
- Cloud Computing: focus on the creation, maintenance and provisioning of cloud computing resources and storage.

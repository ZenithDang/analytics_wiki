## How is Data Analysed? 

Typically to extract meaningful insights an analyst (sometime called a data scientist) will perform analytics on the data. This can range from basic visualization to find trends in the data, to advanced machine learning models to predict customer behaviour. 

Generally, there are three levels of analytics which vary based on the level of complexity of the analysis. These levels in order of simple to complex are: 

- Standard Analytics
- Advanced Analytics 
- Data Science 

### Standard Analytics 

- Summary Statistics (mean, variance etc.)
- Basic Statistical Tests (t.test, chi squared test etc.)
- Visualization (scatter charts, time series charts etc.)

### Advanced Analytics 

- Regression modelling (general linear models, logit models)
- Causal modelling (A/B Testing, Difference in difference modelling etc.) 
- Optimization modelling (linear programming, simulation modelling etc.). 
- Traditional machine learning modelling (boosting models, support vector models etc.). 

### Data Science 

- Large language models
- Neural Networks 
- Novel modelling techniques

## Purpose of statistics 

As described in [Analytics in Practice](Analytics%20in%20Practice.md) the purpose of statistics can be split into three areas based on purpose: 

### Descriptive

Focus on describing the shape, distribution and features of the data. Example statistical methods include: 

- Summary Statistics
	- Mean, Median, mode, Variance, Standard Deviation etc. 
- Visualization
	- Scatter Charts, Bar Charts etc. 
- Hypothesis Testing 
	- t.test, z.test, binomial test etc. 

### Predictive

Focus on predicting outcomes and predictive power of models. Examples statistical methods include:

- Supervised Models 
	- Boosting Models, Tree Models, Linear Models etc. 
- Time Series Modelling 
	- ARIMA, TSLM, etc.  

### Prescriptive

Focus on explaining the relationship between the data on a theoretical level. Examples statistical methods include: 

- Randomized controlled trials (experiments)
- Instrumental Variable Modelling 
- Regression Modelling 
- Causal Diagram (theoretical)


## Statistics and Machine Learning 

[Statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics) is the study and process of collecting, organizing, analyzing, interpreting and visualizing data. As such, given Machine Learning is just a method of analyzing and sometime, interpreting data, it can be said to be a sub-field of statistics that applies algorithms and optimization to model data. 

That being said, some data professionals and academics consider machine learning an AI to be a distinct field from statistics. As is the case argued by this author [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4642).

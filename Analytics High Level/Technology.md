## Tech Stacks 

Generally all analytics projects will leverage a tech stack. This can sometimes be very well specified as clients or companies will have a well defined set of standard tools and technologies they use. This may be due to legal requirements (e.g. needing to use SAS for financial analytics) or data governance (using Databricks to help prevent data silos). 

Other organisations can be very loose and allow greater flexibility. This can be a good thing as it allows you to use the best tool for the job. However, it can also be a bad thing as it can lead to a lot of time being wasted on tool selection and learning. 

## Typical Tech Stacks 

Generally any analytics project will require tools to do the following: 

- Extract or gather data (e.g. Azure Data Factory, Databricks etc.)
- Store Data (Databricks, ADLS, Snowflake etc.)
- Transform and shape data (e.g. Azure Data Factory, Databricks etc.)
- Analyse Data using [Statistics](Statistics.md) (programming languages, SAS, etc.)
- Visualize Data (Power BI, Tableau etc.)
- Collaboration tools (Microsoft teams, Slack, Git etc.)
- Knowledge Management (GitHub Wiki's. Confluence etc.)

However, this is just my way of grouping and thinking about tools. The line of thinking will often differ between organisations and even individual analysts and data professionals. The below gives an extended list with some more new and modern technologies, with a different perspective on grouping tools and technology. This is sourced from:

In general though for an analysts they will mainly be working with three kind of tools: 

- A public cloud environment (Azure, AWS, GCP etc.) to do store and compute data. 
- Programming Languages (Python, R, SQL etc.) to process and analyse data using [Statistics](Statistics.md). 
- An end user interface or report (PDF, PowerPoint, dashboard, Web App, API, etc.).

The above is typical of large clients and businesses who have some level of data literacy. Some companies may favour private clouds and on premise solutions. Furthermore, some analysts may use software with GUI's to process and analyse data such as [Azure ADF ](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/products/data-factory) to process and shape data and [Knime](https://www.knime.com/) to perform analytics.

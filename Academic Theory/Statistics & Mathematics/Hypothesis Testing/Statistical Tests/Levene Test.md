This test used to compare the variance of two or more groups. Under this test the hypothesis are: 

- $H_0$ : The groups variances are equal. 
- $H_1$ : At least one groups variance is different. 

An example of this test can be seen on the [ANOVA](ANOVA.md) page where it is used to test if the data meets the required assumption of equal variances.

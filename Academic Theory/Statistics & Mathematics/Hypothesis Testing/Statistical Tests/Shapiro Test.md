This is a test used to test if data is normally distributed. It is useful for when doing analysis that requires the data be normally distributed. Under this test the hypothesis are: 

- $H_0$ : The data is normally distributed. 
- $H_1$ : The data is not normally distributed. 

An example of this test can be seen on the [ANOVA](ANOVA.md) page where this test is used to see if the residuals are normally distributed, which is an assumption of one way ANOVA.

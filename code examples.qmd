### Chi Square Test of Independence

```{r}
# sample data generation
df <- data.frame(
    education = sample(
        c("high school", "college", "graduate school"), 
        300, 
        TRUE, 
        c(0.2, 0.5, 0.3)
        ),
    occupation = sample(
        c("student", "unemployed", "employed", "self-employed"), 
        300, 
        TRUE, 
        c(0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.3)
        )
    )

# chi square test of independence 
chisq.test(table(df$education, df$occupation))
```

### Fishers Test 

```{r}
# sample data generation
df <- data.frame(
    education = sample(
        c("high school", "college", "graduate school"), 
        30, 
        TRUE, 
        c(0.2, 0.5, 0.3)
        ),
    occupation = sample(
        c("student", "unemployed", "employed", "self-employed"), 
        30, 
        TRUE, 
        c(0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.3)
        )
    )

# fishers test
fisher.test(table(df$education, df$occupation))
